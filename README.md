1. Created a software implementation of the procedure for displaying the coordinate plane on the screen with the possibility for the user to select the designation of the pending values, the minimum and maximum values, as well as the digitization step for each of the axes.
2. Organized a user-friendly interface for entering initial data and selecting a procedure for studying a function.
3. Organized validation of the input of numerical data from the keyboard.
4. Created a software implementation of the following procedures for studying the function of one variable:
-Displaying a graph of the function under study with user-specified parameters.
-Changing the display of the graph of the function under study in a given way in accordance with the commands given from the keyboard. When one of the given keys is pressed on the keyboard, the parameter under study is increased by the value of the specified step, and when another key is pressed on the keyboard, it is decreased by the value of the specified step.
-Search for the extremum of the function by a given optimization method on a user-defined interval of change of the independent variable. Display on the screen of the process of approaching the extremum. Counting the number of steps in the optimization process.
-Optimization of displaying and printing in tabular form, saving to a file and reading from it the data specified by the number of the variant. Organization of file name selection when saving and reading data. Checking the correctness of the specified file name.
5. Investigation of a function of two variables.
-Displaying the function under study with user-specified parameters on the plane in a specified way. Level lines or characteristics should be displayed in different colors.
-Search for the extremum of a function by a given optimization method on user-defined intervals of change of independent variables. Display on the screen of the process of approaching the extremum. Counting the number of steps in the optimization process.
6. Used optimization methods.
7. When working in a visual programming environment, create a Windows application that implements the solution formulated in p.p. 1-5 tasks, as well as those listed below.
-Creation of an application of a given type with a dialog box and a set of controls in accordance with the assignment for a term paper for entering data, selecting the type of problem to be solved and solving it.
-Solving the problem of finding a conditional extremum in a linear programming problem.
-Selection of the initial approximation when solving problems of finding an extremum by clicking on the left button of the "mouse" type manipulator on a point of the function graph.
-Resizing the window.
-A set of functions from given elements for a function of several variables.
-Create a spreadsheet with data.
-Organization of printing from the application of a graphic image.
